title: "Executive Presence for SEOs - Course Beta #2"
layout: page
---

Getting buy-in & resources is the number one frustration for SEO professionals. And in my own experience there are far more SEOs that have knowledge of how SEO works than how businesses operate.

That's why I'm building the course: Executive Presence for SEOs.

It's designed to teach you:

- How to create effective SEO strategies
- How to communicate your ideas
- How to present to executives
- How to get buy-in and effect change

The course is designed for in-house, agency and solo folks but you'll get the most value from the course if you're working with larger companies where cross-functional issues and executive presence matter most.

## Course Schedule & Outline

The format is a weekly 90-min zoom at 12pm ET for five weeks. Topics and dates:

- September 15th: Good SEO Strategy
- September 22nd: Models & Forecasts
- September 29th: Effective Presentations
- October 6th: Effecting Change
- October 13th: Wrap-up & Group Discussion

I'll cap seats at 10-15 so it'll be a small group each week.

In addition you should expect 1-2 hours a week of reading and homework assignments.

## This is a beta!

Warning: This is a beta which means it's a work in progress! I've been refining the course materials for a while and already run one beta cohort but you should be prepared for a few rough edges.

Throughout the course I'll be sending surveys and feedback links and I'd really love it if you can fill these out as this will help improve the course for the next round.

## Feedback from the first cohort

The first time I ran the course people had some nice things to say:

I was part of the SEO MBA beta cohort and I highly recommend this course to SEOs who are looking to level up their strategic skills. The course covers all things SEO strategy including forecasting, effective presentations and working cross-functionally with different teams. Throughout the course, Tom shares processes and examples that are applicable to those client-side, agency-side and solo consultants. It’s extremely actionable and includes lots of learnings that I embedded in my day to day work. <strong>Most importantly, I now feel much more confident presenting my SEO vision to leadership and executive teams</strong>.

Including some nice immediate results:

If you want to learn exactly how to present ideas and get executive buy-in for SEO projects, SEO MBA is easily the most important and unique course you can invest your time in. Unlike any other SEO training or course, SEO MBA teaches you how to build a presentation and strategy to get executive buy-in upfront. Tom’s one simple tip on what to how to write a slide headline (and exactly what not to do) has radically transformed our client presentation and pitch decks. <strong>The course ended last week and it has already helped our entire agency communicate better and close 2 high quality six-figure deals.</strong>

Remember, this course isn't about teaching you *how to do SEO*. It's teaching you how to be an effective senior level SEO professional:

8 years into my career as a professional SEO, Tom's MBA has helped me discover new ways to pitch projects, present forecasts and slide decks, drive change in large organizations and think more strategically. <strong>There are a lot of SEO courses that will tell you how to write a title tag or conduct keyword research. This is not one of them. Tom operates on another level, and you should consider yourself lucky if you ever get the chance to pick his brain about any SEO- and strategy related topic</strong>.
