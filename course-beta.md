title: "Client Management  - Course Beta #2"
layout: page
---

If you work at an SEO agency or as an independent consultant, managing clients is essential to the success of your work. This course isn't about *account management* or *project management* - it's about fundamentally working with clients to **get things done**.

Good SEO is fundamentally consultative - you need to go beyond simply providing recommendations, to persuading and supporting clients in implementing our recommendations. That's why I'm building a course to deepen your client management skills

This course is designed for mid-career agency SEO professionals (and freelancers) who need to get better at working with clients. The topis we'll cover:

- Manage client expectations
- Communicate the value of SEO
- Build trust and client relationships
- Retain and upsell client projects

Ultimately it's about improving your client communication skills to be more effective, more confident and level up your career.

## Course Curriculum

The beta course format is a live cohort of 10-15 people meeting for 90 mins / week for 5 weeks. The structure is roughly:

- Week 1: What is client management and why it matters
- Week 2: Alignment: 
- Week 3: Clarity
- Week 4: Trust
- Week 5: Example agency positioning, sales, SOW, kickoff, upsell

## This is a beta!

Warning: This is a beta which means it's a work in progress! I'm confident the course will be valuable but it may also be slightly less raw and not as polished as the final course. Throughout the course I'll be sending surveys to gather feedback and I'd really love it if you can fill these out as we go.
