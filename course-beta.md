title: Executive Presence for SEOs - Course Beta '#2'
layout: page
---

Getting buy-in & resources is the number one frustration for SEO professionals. And in my own experience there are far more SEOs that have knowledge of how SEO works than how businesses operate.

That's why I'm building the course: Executive Presence for SEOs.

It's designed to teach you:

- How to create effective SEO strategies
- How to communicate your ideas 
- Get buy-in

## This is a beta!

This is a beta which means it's a work in progress! It's important to know that going in. I'll be asking for feedback 

But it's the second time I'll be running it. Last time, people had some nice things to say:

> I was part of the SEO MBA beta cohort and I highly recommend this course to SEOs who are looking to level up their strategic skills. The course covers all things SEO strategy including forecasting, effective presentations and working cross-functionally with different teams. Throughout the course, Tom shares processes and examples that are applicable to those client-side, agency-side and solo consultants. It’s extremely actionable and includes lots of learnings that I embedded in my day to day work. **Most importantly, I now feel much more confident presenting my SEO vision to leadership and executive teams**.

And:

> If you want to learn exactly how to present ideas and get executive buy-in for SEO projects, SEO MBA is easily the most important and unique course you can invest your time in. Unlike any other SEO training or course, SEO MBA teaches you how to build a presentation and strategy to get executive buy-in upfront. Tom’s one simple tip on what to how to write a slide headline (and exactly what not to do) has radically transformed our client presentation and pitch decks. **The course ended last week and it has already helped our entire agency communicate better and close 2 high quality six-figure deals.**

So hopefully
