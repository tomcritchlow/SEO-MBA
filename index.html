      <h1>An Announcement about the Future of the SEO MBA</h1>
      <p>Hey, it's me Tom Critchlow and I've got a little announcement.</p>
      <p class="seomba-red b">Here's the short version: I'm going through some career/life changes (more on that soon) and so after 3 years of running the SEO MBA, I'm shutting down new course sales on Aug 31st 2024.</p>
      <p>If you want to grab access before the courses get pulled down, buy the bundle for $500:</p>
      <script src="https://cdn.podia.com/embeds.js" async="async"></script><a href="https://courses.seomba.com/two-course-professional-bundle-executive-presence-the-art-of-client-management" data-podia-embed="card">Two Course Bundle: Executive Presence & The Art of Client Management</a>
      
      <p>Here’s the longer version:</p>

      <h2>Two courses, Three years and 800 students later… </h2>
      
      <p>I started the SEO MBA three years ago because I saw a skills gap in the industry. Too many SEO professionals were missing out on opportunities because they didn’t have the business, communication and strategy skills to influence and lead change inside their organization or inside their clients’ organizations.</p>
      
      <p>I had a hunch this was going to be popular and well received but… damn.</p>
      
      <p>Two courses, Three years, Six cohorts and over 800 students later it’s time to take a pause.</p>
      
      <p>If you haven’t yet enrolled and want to grab the course before I pull it down, you can get both courses bundled together for $500 here (normally $975 combined), on sale until Aug 31st: <a href="https://courses.seomba.com/two-course-professional-bundle-executive-presence-the-art-of-client-management" data-podia-embed="link">Two Course Bundle: Executive Presence & The Art of Client Management</a></p>
      
      <p>I’m most proud of the 100s of notes, testimonials and student stories people have shared.</p>
      
      <p>Stories like this one I received last week about getting a new job:</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Or stories like this one about building out whole teams:</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Or stories like this one about helping freelancers charge more:</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Or stories like this one about helping people do more than “just SEO”:</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Or stories like this one about helping people feel more confident:</p>
      
      
      
      <p>I’m proud of the courses I built - I really tried hard to build something that was valuable and different than everything else out there.</p>
      
      <p>But - the truth is that juggling this project alongside my consulting business has been challenging… It’s hard to juggle multiple priorities!</p>
      
      <p>Ultimately, I’m sure the SEO MBA will return one day in a new form. (I’m a weirdo who really cares about executive presence and business skills after all!) But for now there’s a different project I’ve gotta go invest my time and energy into - more details on that soon - so I’m pausing sign ups after August 31st.</p>
      
      <h2>Thank You</h2>
      
      <p>I want to give a huge, heartfelt thank you to everyone you supported the course, bought the course, promoted the course, gave a testimonial, said something nice or mentioned it on stage at a conference. There’s too many people to thank individually but I want to especially shout out folks who have been on the journey the whole way like Areej and John-Henry who enrolled in some of the very first beta cohorts, gave loving feedback and have been champions and advocates for the courses the whole way.</p>
      
      <p>And of course Will who taught me everything I know about executive presence. ❤️</p>
      
      <p>And of course Erin who painted a canvas for my course background, let me shoot the videos in her art studio, worked some late nights with me, helped transcribe my videos and helped me get this thing out in the world.</p>
      
      <p>Much love, Tom xo.</p>
