    <p class="measure center tl f4 lh-copy">
      The #1 challenge for SEO professionals is not technical know-how, but knowing how to get buy-in and budget. Industry surveys consistently rate it as the biggest challenge:
      <br><br>
      <em>“The top 5 challenges are all SEO resource and execution challenges”</em> - <span class="f5">Source: <a href="https://www.aleydasolis.com/en/search-engine-optimization/how-to-winning-seo-website-audit-growth/">Aleyda Solis' Survey</a></span>

    <br><br>
      SEO fundamentally requires other teams to invest <em>their</em> resources in our projects, whether it's the product, marketing or editorial team.

      Recognize any of these?

      <br><mark><em>- Not getting the resources you need to get things done</em></mark>

      This course isn't about technical audits or keyword research. This course focuses on the business, leadership and consulting skills that you need to be more effective in your job and operate at more senior levels of business.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>How long will the weekly office hours continue?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">Office hours are held weekly and will continue at least through the end of 2022.</div>
  </details>  

  <details>
    <summary>What if I can't make the office hours?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">I can't guarantee to cover every single time zone but I'll do my best to vary the time of day and day of he week so that everyone can get a chance to attend these sessions. Most commonly they'll be Thursday morning, Eastern Time</div>
  </details>    

  <details>
    <summary>Do I have to follow the 5 week schedule?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">No, you don't have to. You get lifetime access to all of the materials on day 1 and can study at your own pace. That said there's a lot of materials so I suggest pacing yourself with the weekly emails!</div>
  </details>    

  <details>
    <summary>Do you have a 1-pager PDF I can show my boss?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">Sure! Take a look at <a href="/SEOMBA-executive-presence-overview.pdf">this PDF</a> or the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zLE97s5Ic0EJrmMoZ0qa64KNbJeyMWbi3hod3JLzvPA/edit">Google Docs version</a></div>
  </details>        

  <details>
    <summary>I work on small business SEO. Is this course for me?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">While the course content should be useful and applicable to everyone, it's geared towards SEOs working with medium and large organizations where business skills, investment models and presentations are most impactful.</div>
  </details>  

  <details>
    <summary>Will this course share any advanced technical SEO?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">No. In fact, there's very little "SEO advice" in the whole course. The focus is specifically on developing the business, leadership and consulting skills that you need to become a more senior SEO professional, not tips and tricks.</div>
  </details>   

  <details>
    <summary>Can I get my company to pay for this?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">I hope so! Many organizations have L&D, training and professional development budgets that you can use to help pay for the course. Feel free to put your manager in touch with me!</div>
  </details>   
  
  <details>
    <summary>Can I pay by invoice?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">Sure thing. Send me an email: tom@seomba.com and I'll get you set up.</div>
  </details>  

  <details>
    <summary>Is there a discount for buying multiple seats?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">Sure thing. Send me an email: tom@seomba.com and I'll get you set up.</div>
  </details>    
  
  <details>
    <summary>Do I get a certificate when I complete the course?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">Yes! You'll receive a digital certificate when you complete the course materials.</div>
  </details>    

  <details>
    <summary>Can I book a private 1:1 if I did not purchase the Executive tier?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">Sure! If you decide once you've done the course that you wish you had booked another tier for more personal feedback, you can purchase a 45 minute 1:1 chat separately. Just email me: tom@seomba.com</div>
  </details>      

  <details>
    <summary>Can I get a refund?</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">If you've watched the videos and still aren't getting value then send me an email within 60 days and I'll refund you the course: tom@seomba.com</div>
  </details>    
  
  <details>
    <summary>I have more questions...</summary>
    <div class="pa3 bg-white">Ok! Shoot me an email: tom@seomba.com</div>
