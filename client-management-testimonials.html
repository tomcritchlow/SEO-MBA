He was able to answer all questions but also bring in new ideas and concepts through his responses to my questions."

I've seen and experienced a wide range of internal agency and external client-facing scenarios that made me feel very well equipped for every interaction I came across. The SEO MBA course opened my eyes to a different way of viewing client management, change management, and interpersonal communication that has allowed me to level up my interactions across the board."

          Tom brought a really conversational and relatable point of view to each lesson that made the concepts really easy to understand and incredibly actionable. The group workshops and homework assignments provided the opportunity to grapple with core concepts in a very hands-on way and built on the coursework from both a theoretical and a practical perspective.
          <br><br>
          The takeaways from the SEO MBA course transcend just client-side SEO, with applications across any role where technical expertise needs to be communicated across an organizational hierarchy. I highly recommend this course for both marketing consultants working with clients and in-house marketers working with internal teams and vendors to gain the valuable perspective needed to distill technical insights, transform insights into solutions, turn solutions into actions, and communicate the impact of those actions in a way that perpetuates trust, authority, and expertise."
