<p class="lh-copy">The biggest challenge for SEO professionals is not knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get it done:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>43% of SEO cite lack of buy-in or resources as the biggest risk to SEO success</li>
    <li>The top 5 SEO challenges are all resource and execution challenges</li>
    <li>The average SEO at a big company has been waiting over six months for their highest priority technical change</li>
  </ul>
<p class="lh-copy">SEO fundamentally requires other teams to invest their resources in our projects, whether it's the product, marketing or editorial team.
  <br><br>
  This course isn't about technical audits or keyword research. This course focuses on the business, leadership and consulting skills that you need to be more effective in your job and operate at more senior levels of business.</p>
