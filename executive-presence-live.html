<p>The #1 challenge for SEO professionals is not technical know-how, but knowing how to get buy-in and budget. Industry surveys consistently rate it as the biggest challenge:

  “The top 5 challenges are all SEO resource and execution challenges” - source
  
  “The average SEO at a big company has been waiting over six months for their highest priority technical change and doesn’t anticipate seeing it deployed for at least another six months” - source
  
  “43% of people cite lack of buy-in or resources as the biggest risk to SEO success.” - source
  
  SEO fundamentally requires other teams to invest their resources in our projects, whether it's the product, marketing or editorial team.
  
  This course isn't about technical audits or keyword research. This course focuses on the business, leadership and consulting skills that you need to be more effective in your job and operate at more senior levels of business.</p>

  {% include testimonial.html

    quote = "Tom is a ‘next level’ SEO expert. So to be able to learn directly from him is an unmissable opportunity. Additionally, this course covers a topic which is often overlooked in the SEO space, how do we as SEOs deliver our expertise to business decision-makers?  I’m confident in my ability to teach SEO, but breaking it down into ‘Exec speech’ is a completely different skill set.
    <br><br>
    The information in the course is high value, as it enables me to get buy-in from Directors and C-suite, over and above the trust I have as an SEO expert.
    <br><br>  
    The format of the course allows me to work on my own time, not rushing progress and directly applies to my day-to-day communications with senior management. I have already benefitted from Tom’s teaching and I am only partway through the course content."
