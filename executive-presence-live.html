<p class="lh-copy">The biggest challenge for SEO professionals is not knowing <span class="b i">what to do</span>, it's knowing <span class="b i">how to get it done</span>. Do you recognize any of these?
<br>
<br>- Difficulty getting buy-in and budget from executives
<br>- Challenges demonstrating the value of SEO
<br>- Lacking confidence presenting SEO to the C-suite
<br>- Not getting the resources you need to get things done
<br><br>
You're not alone, industry surveys consistently rate buy-in and influence as the biggest challenge:</p>
  <ul class="lh-copy">
    <li class="pv2">43% of SEO cite lack of buy-in or resources as the biggest risk to SEO success</li>
    <li class="pv2">The top 5 SEO challenges are all resource and execution challenges</li>
    <li class="pv2">The average SEO at a big company has been waiting over six months for their highest priority technical change</li>
  </ul>
<p class="lh-copy">SEO fundamentally requires other teams to invest <span class="b i">their resources</span> in <span class="b i">our projects</span>, whether it's the product, engineering marketing or editorial teams.
  <br><br>
  This course isn't about technical audits or keyword research. This course focuses on the business, leadership and consulting skills that you need to be more effective in your job and operate at more senior levels of business.</p>

  <div class="flex">
    <div class="w-two-thirds">
      <p>I've worn many hats in my career - working in-house, agency-side and as an independent consultant. I've worked with clients like the New York Times, Etsy, Dotdash & Google.</p>
  <p>My work is currently 100% focused on working with CEOs and executive teams and I see first hand the challenges SEO professionals face in getting their work the buy-in, budget and resources it needs.</p>
  <p>In my consulting work, I've helped companies structure large scale SEO investments and led hiring for senior SEO roles. What I've seen is that there's a big skills gap in the market for technically competent SEOs to gain crucial business skills in order to operate at the most senior levels of business.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>How long will the weekly office hours continue?</summary>

    </details>  
  
    <details>
      <summary>What if I can't make the office hours?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">I can't guarantee to cover every single time zone but I'll do my best to vary the time of day and day of the week so that everyone can get a chance to attend these sessions. Most commonly they'll be Thursday morning, Eastern Time</div>
    </details>    
  
    <details>
      <summary>Do I have to follow the 5 week schedule?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">No, you don't have to. You get lifetime access to all of the materials on day 1 and can study at your own pace. That said there's a lot of materials so I suggest pacing yourself with the weekly emails!</div>
    </details>    
  
    <details>
      <summary>Do you have a 1-pager PDF I can show my boss?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">Sure! Take a look at <a href="/SEOMBA-executive-presence-overview.pdf">this PDF</a> or the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zLE97s5Ic0EJrmMoZ0qa64KNbJeyMWbi3hod3JLzvPA/edit">Google Docs version</a></div>

    </details>  
  
    <details>
      <summary>Will this course share any advanced technical SEO?</summary>
