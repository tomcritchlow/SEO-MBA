<h2 class="f2 cormorant">The biggest challenge for SEO professionals is not knowing <span class="i">what</span> to do, it's knowing <span class="i red">how to get it done</span></h2>
<p class="lh-copy">Do you recognize any of these?
<br>
<br>
<mark>- Difficulty getting buy-in and budget from executives
<br>- Challenges demonstrating the value of SEO
<br>- Lacking confidence presenting SEO to the C-suite
<br>- Not getting the resources you need to get things done</mark>
<br><br>
<strong>You're not alone.</strong>
<br><br>
Industry surveys consistently rate buy-in and influence as the biggest challenge:</p>

  <ul class="lh-copy">
    <li class="pv2"><em>“The top 5 SEO challenges are all resource and execution challenges”</em> - <span class="f5"><a href="https://www.aleydasolis.com/en/search-engine-optimization/how-to-winning-seo-website-audit-growth/">source</a></span></li>
    <li class="pv2"><em>“43% of people cite lack of buy-in or resources as the biggest risk to SEO success.”</em> - <span class="f5"><a href="https://aira.net/state-of-technical-seo/the-impact-of-technical-seo/">source</a></span></li>

  <br><br>
  This course isn't about technical audits or keyword research. This course focuses on the business, leadership and consulting skills that you need to be more effective in your job and operate at more senior levels of business.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>What if I have to miss some of the live sessions?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">No worries! In addition to the live sessions you'll get access to the full video course so you can always catch up and take part in the course if you miss a session.</div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What is the difference between live instruction and studio sessions?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">The live instruction sessions (Mondays) are designed to help learn new concepts, develop mental models and skills and learn the ideas from the course. The studio sessions (Wednesdays) are designed to give you time to practice and apply the skills from the course to really make sure the ideas stick and so you can learn how to apply them to your own work.</div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>What if I already purchased the self-paced course - is there a discount?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">Sure thing! Managing a cohort is a lot of work and places are limited, so I can't discount the course too much but check your email for a discount.</div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I get my company to pay for this?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">I hope so! Many organizations have L&D, training and professional development budgets that you can use to help pay for the course. Feel free to put your manager in touch with me!</div>
    </details>   
    
    <details>
      <summary>Can I pay by invoice?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">Sure thing. Send me an email: tom@seomba.com and I'll get you set up.</div>
    </details>    
    
    <details>
      <summary>I work on small business SEO. Is this course for me?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">While the course content should be useful and applicable to everyone, it's geared towards SEOs working with medium and large organizations where business skills, investment models and presentations are most impactful.</div>
    </details>  
  
    <details>
      <summary>Will this course share any advanced technical SEO?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">No. In fact, there's very little "SEO advice" in the whole course. The focus is specifically on developing the business, leadership and consulting skills that you need to become a more senior SEO professional, not tips and tricks.</div>
    </details>   
    
    <details>
      <summary>Do I get a certificate when I complete the course?</summary>
      <div class="pa3 bg-white">Yes! You'll receive a digital certificate when you complete the course materials.</div>
    </details>
