        In addition to the self-paced online course I've run private workshops for agencies, holding companies and in-house teams.
        <br><br>Want to discuss a corporate workshop or a group discount? Get in touch, book a chat <a class="link seomba-red" href="https://calendly.com/tomcritchlow/tom-chat">via calendly</a> or email me: <a class="link seomba-red" href="mailto:tom@seomba.com">tom@seomba.com</a>
        </p>

        <h2 cl>Option 1: Test & Learn</h2>
        <p>If you're considering the course for your company and want to test drive it first, this option enables you to get a feel for the material. This provides access to the <a class="link seomba-red" href="https://seomba.com/executive-presence/">full self-paced course</a> but also provides 1:1 feedback on the individual assignments and a <strong>60 minute coaching session with Tom Critchlow</strong> for each participant.</p>
        <p>Pricing: $1,500 / person (designed for 1-3 people)</p>
        <p><em class="black-60">If you decide to purchase a group package later on this price will be discounted from the total</em></p>

        <h2>Option 2: Group Discounts</h2>
        <p>For large teams, group pricing is available as follows:</p>
        <p><ul>
                <li>3+ seats: 10% discount</li>
                <li>5+ seats: 15% discount</li>
                <li>10+ seats: 20% discount</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, if you purchase 10+ seats I will add a <strong>90 minute private Q&A session with your team</strong> where we can review course material and discuss real challenges in a private setting.
        </p>

        <h2>Option 3: Private Live Course</h2>
        <p>If you have a large group and want an immersive, live version of the course, customized to your needs then choose the private cohort.<br><br> The format is 5 weeks of 90-minute zoom calls where we go through the course materials together, with plenty of time for group discussion. The benefits of the live version are: guaranteed engagement, discussion and application to real challenges the group is facing and customized outcomes based on your goals.</p>
        <p>Format: initial 60 minute conversation to align on goals and customize the course followed by 5 weeks of 90-min zoom calls. In addition, everyone in the course gets 1:1 feedback on the assignments.</p>
        <p>Pricing: $12,000 (designed for 8-12 people)</p>

        <p>Over 200 SEO professionals have enrolled in the course, here's some of what they say:</p>
