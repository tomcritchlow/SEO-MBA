title: Launched the SEO MBA log!
---

You know the word blog use to be short for "web-log". But we don't call things web-things anymore. We just call them, well... things. So maybe we need to stop calling them blogs and just start calling them... logs?

The name feels right for me because I'm specifically using this as a kind of public record. I want to document the behind-the-scenes, talk about the process of building and launching online courses, growing email subscribers and more. But I also want it to be a personal log of things I did! I want to remember a bit of how I felt when I put my first course live, or where I was when I was running a beta course.

The SEO MBA is increasingly my full time income and who the F knows where it's going - but the least I can do is keep a record of where it's been.

It looks something like this:
