I put up a [dedicated page for corporate workshops and group buys](https://seomba.com/workshops/) with some clear pricing options for teams that want to engage with the course. I've had a handful of 10+ groups enroll in the course and I'd like to have more of those!

In particular, it' s fairly well established the finding a cohort of peers to learn with improves learning outcomes. More insights into the [cohort model in this post](https://future.a16z.com/cohort-based-courses/).
