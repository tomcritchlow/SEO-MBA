Today I implemented parity pricing for the courses meaning that if you visit the page from a range of countries outside the US (for example Brazil, Mexico and many others) you'll see a discount code. It's not perfect - and certainly not exactly fair (I have to manage the tradeoff between complete fairness and admin overhead). But it's more fair than it was before! So that feels good.

I was inspired by [this post](https://wesbos.com/parity-purchasing-power) and relied on some data from this [parity pricing calculator](https://www.exportator.com/purchasing-power-parity-pricing-calculator).

I'll write more about this soon but for now it's kind of a soft launch to check it's all working as intended.
