title: About the SEO MBA
---

Hi, I’m Tom. I’ve spent the last 15 years working in SEO and digital media. I opened up the Distilled NYC office in 2011, worked at Google for a few years and have been running my own consulting business for the last 6 years.  

I’ve spent the last two years embedded inside some large organizations helping them restructure and build new SEO teams - and my latest gig involved hiring a VP SEO position and several senior SEO roles underneath.

From running a bunch of senior level interviews it became clear to me that the biggest skills gap in the industry is the ability to get things done and operate at the executive layer of an organization.

SEO is by nature a cross-disciplinary activity - it requires collaboration between product, technology, content, PR, marketing and more. So, it’s no surprise that the number one frustration for SEO professionals is getting things done.

To be an effective senior SEO professional you need some business skills. You need the ability to present ideas to the c-suite, create a compelling business case for multi-million dollar investments and work cross-functionally to gather buy-in from stakeholders.

I call this executive presence.

Executive presence is essential whether you’re working in-house, agency side or freelance. Unfortunately, learning executive presence is hard - it’s a tacit set of skills that are best learned from observation, imitation and practice.

That’s why I’m launching not only this newsletter but also a hands-on online course - to provide an environment for learning and growth that can actually teach you some of these skills.

There are plenty of people in the industry who are knowledgeable SEOs, well versed in the technical specifics, data analysis, algorithm updates and ranking signals. While interviewing senior SEOs I spoke to a lot of people who know more than I do about some of the technical aspects of how SEO works.

Unfortunately, technical expertise doesn’t matter if you can’t  operate at the executive layer of an organization. Too many SEOs lack the ability to create a compelling vision, tell a persuasive story, gather buy-in across the organization or work with other departments.

So, here’s the summary:

I'm launching the SEO MBA - a free newsletter focused on the business & leadership skills necessary for SEOs to succeed at the executive level.

There’s going to be very little technical SEO advice. Instead I’m going to focus on helping you become a more confident and effective executive-level professional.

In addition to the newsletter (which is free) I’m developing some online training programs to teach executive presence. Sign up for updates and more info.
