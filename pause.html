      <h1>An Announcement about the Future of the SEO MBA</h1>
      <p>Hey, it's me Tom Critchlow and I've got a little announcement.</p>
      <p>Here's the short version: I'm going through some career/life changes (more on that soon) and so after 3 years of running the SEO MBA, I'm shutting down new course sales on Aug 31st 2024.</p>
      <p>If you want to grab access before the courses get pulled down buy the bundle for $500 (was $1175)</p>
      <h2>The Longer Version</h2>
      <p>When I launched the SEO MBA in 2021 I had no idea that I'd reach over 12,000 subscribers and over 800 people would enroll in a course. Giving people new careers, new confidence, new skills</p>
      <p>New jobs:</p>
      <p>New confidence:</p>
      <p>New skills:</p>
      <p>New ways of thinking about SEO:</p>
      <p>But the truth is that juggling this alongside my consulting business has been challenging. It's hard to juggle multiple priorities! I haven't written a newsletter January!</p>
      <p>Ultimately, this is just a pause. I've got a new project that I have to go invest my energy into so for now I'm going to pause new signpus. But I'm still a weirdo and passionate about improving the state of communication and business skills.</p>
      <p>Much love. Tom xo.</p>
