SEO is an outcome, but companies treat it like a function. This disconnect leads to broken SEO programs that are ineffective, with SEO teams internally that lack trust and buy-in. Instead modern SEO requires embedding SEO processes and knowledge in the right place (i.e. directly within product and content teams) supported by metrics and reporting that ties SEO to business value.

I’ve been working in SEO for 15+ years and have consulted with 100s of companies large and small. My focus now is on helping companies assess and build SEO capabilities. This approach rejects the traditional “SEO audit” mentality and takes a deeper root cause analysis to build more effective and sustainable SEO programs.

## Example Project

* SEO maturity analysis. Benchmark where your organization is at.
* SEO investment strategy. Use this so structure investment, teams and hiring.
* Due diligence. For companies looking to make acquisitions, ensure that you understand the SEO TAM, capabilities and value of the existing SEO capabilities.
* Advisor to CMOs and CPOs on product

## What People Say:

> “Tom is a CEO Whisperer. He is truly a world-class listener and mentor who knows how to knock down walls inside companies to get strategic projects delivered.”

*"Tom is one of the clearest business thinkers I’ve ever had the privilege of working with. His ability to synthesize complex and copious amounts of ideas and material into clear and operational strategy is unparallelled.

"Tom Critchlow is one of the best I've worked with when it comes to SEO. We worked together on a startup and he has that amazing blend of seeing the big picture and being able to roll up his sleeves to get the work done. The results were fantastic, where we developed the building blocks for our key money pages and then executed the plan to dramatically increase the organic traffic to those pages."
